# NN-from-scratch
## Description
This project is for implementation of backpropagation learning rules for neural networks. Use the network structure, three layer full connected, to derive the backpropagation learning rules for all adjustable parameters in the network with different activation functions.  
## Dataset
Mnist dataset
## File explanation
1. ***Mnist_back_sigmoid.ipynb*** is NN, I code backward propagation from scratch and activation function is sigmoid.  
2. ***Mnist_back_tanh.ipynb*** is NN, I code backward propagation from scratch and activation function is tanh.  
3. ***Mnist_keras.ipynb*** is NN and I use keras to build model and train.  
4. ***Mnist_RBF.ipynb*** is RBF and I use keras to build model and train.
